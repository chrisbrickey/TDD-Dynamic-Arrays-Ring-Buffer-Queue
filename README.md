# TESTING >>>>DD for Dynamic Array, Ring Buffer, and Queue
This is a study in the underlying behavior of high-level arrays (e.g. Python lists).  Using test-driven development, I've created classes that mimic the arrays of higher-level languages with an API (e.g. push, pop methods) that operates on static arrays.

## To run tests from command line
- All tests: `bundle exec rspec`
- Specific classes: `bundle exec rspec spec\filename.ext`

## Dependencies (RSpec 3.6)
- ruby 2.4.0
- rspec-core 3.6.0
- rspec-expectations 3.6.0
- rspec-mocks 3.6.0
- rspec-support 3.6.0Ã‚
